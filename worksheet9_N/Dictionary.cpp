/*
  Dictionary

  We have a vector of words. We can assume these words are:
  * lowercase
  * clean
  * no punctuation or spaces
  
  We will write functions to access and arrange these words. All functions should 
  * use iterators both to navigate and access all data (not indices)
  * return iterators (where applicable)
  * be mindful and clear about when a function alters its given data
  * assume that the list of words could be large
  
  For each function, write the function, determine the exact growth calculation, and
  give the O-notation.
  * Linear Search
  * Bubble Sort
  * Binary Search
  * Selection Sort
