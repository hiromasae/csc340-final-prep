/*
  TRANSPOSE

  goal: 
    Read in a square matrix of integers from a text file into a
    2D vector. Then create a new vector which is a transpose
    of the first vector.
    * function: reads file into vector
    * function: transposes vector, returns new vector
    * function: print vector in 2D table form
    * function: print diagonals of vector
  
  plan:
    (1) start by assuming the read-from-file function is written
    (2) write the print 2D vector function
    (3) write the transpose function
    (4) write the print-the-diagonals function
    (5) Can this be done for a rectangular vector?
