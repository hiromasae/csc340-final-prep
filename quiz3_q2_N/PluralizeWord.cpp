/*
  Write a function which takes a vector of strings and a word to search for (assume all words are lowercase and
  contain only alphabet characters a through z). The function should use iterators to navigate and access the 
  vector, not indices. The function should find the given word in the vector and pluralize it - in other words,
  add and 's' to the end of that word in the vector. Return and iterator to this updated word. If the word is not
  found, return an iterator that has the .end() value. Note: as usual, using the auto or size_t keywords for
  known types is not allowed (and all types in this problem are known). Additionally, for quizzes/exams we will
  not use for-each loops (regular for loops are okay).
