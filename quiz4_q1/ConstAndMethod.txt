(1) The definition above is part of Point_h. What does the const keyword mean in this context? Explain briefly
    which variable it refers to and why we need it. 

const in this context means that getX() is as constant member function. This means that getX() cannot change 
any of the object's data members. We need it to ensure that the getX() function will not modify the state of
the Point object.  


(2) What are the differences between a method and a function in C++?

All methods are functions but not all functions are methods. The term "method" is used when a function is part
of a class.
