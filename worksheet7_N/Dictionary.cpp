/*
  DICTIONARY
  
  goal:
    We have a text file of words. We can assume these words are:
      * lowercase
      * clean (all letters, no weird characters)
      * no punctuation or spaces 
    
    We will write functions to access and arrange these words.
    All functions should
      * use iterators both to navigate and and to access data (not indices)
      * return iterators (where applicable)
      * be mindful and clear about when a function alters its given data
      * assume that the list of words could be large
      
  assignment (create a function for each task):
    (1) read the words from the file into a vector
    (2) print the words to the screen
    (3) find a particular word
    (4) output the list to a new file, without overwriting existing files
